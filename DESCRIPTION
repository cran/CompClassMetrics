Description: Accuracy metrics are commonly used to assess the discriminating ability of diagnostic tests or biomarkers. Among them, metrics based on the ROC framework are particularly popular. When classification involves subclasses, the package 'CompClassMetrics' includes functions that can provide the point estimate, confidence interval as well as true values if a parametric setting is known.
